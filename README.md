## **The Problem**üö´

- Many pet lovers want to adoption new pets and do not know where to start looking for them, and even if they are found after a long struggle, they do not know how to take care of them if they do not have experience in caring for them.

- Many pet owners sometimes want to find a new permanent or temporary home for their pet, so they do not want to leave it homeless and find it challenging to find new owners for their animals.
